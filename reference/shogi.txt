9x9 board

First iteration failure:
    - how to update board when Position, Piece in separate crate

Fix ideas:
    - Wrapper class for Bitboard, Piece
    - Each piece has shogi::Piece, egui::ImageButton
    - One active piece at a time
    - If active, render_board will use a bigger size for the image button
    - If active and click on cell, see if valid move
    - If active and click on enemy piece, capture
    - If active and click on ally piece, active is now on ally piece
